## Official Implementation of The Trifecta Algorithm

Pytorch (lightning) code implementation of TFF (Trifecta Forward-Forward).

**Goal.** The Trifecta aims to solve three weaknesses of the Forward-Forward algorithm (Hinton 2022). This allows the training of deeper networks which can achieve higher accuracy.

**Code.** The code, written in Pytorch, is organised to be both flexible and readable. The full implementation is only 300 lines long, including boilerplate.
